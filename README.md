# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

what is the use of reportwebVital ?

reportWebVitals is a function provided by Create React App (CRA) that helps developers measure and monitor the performance of their web applications. It collects Web Vitals, which are key metrics that reflect the real-world performance of a website, especially in terms of user experience.

reportWebVitals is a tool that helps you measure how fast and smooth your website is for users. It collects important performance metrics, called Web Vitals, that tell you things like:

How fast the page loads (Largest Contentful Paint or LCP).
How quickly users can interact with the page (First Input Delay or FID).
How stable the layout is while the page is loading (Cumulative Layout Shift or CLS).
You can use these measurements to understand if users are having a good experience or if there are problems like slow loading, delays when clicking buttons, or parts of the page shifting around unexpectedly.

Why Use It?
Find Slow Areas: It helps you identify which parts of your website might be too slow.
Improve User Experience: You can see what needs to be improved to make the site faster and easier to use.
Track Changes: It lets you track performance over time, so you can see if updates make the site better or worse.
